A simple `PWA` app to play the Mexican "Gallo de Don Clemente" lottery.

## Motivation
This application was created as an exercise to learn the basics of `PWA`
development.

I won't deny that I built this because I was bored, but in the end I think it
turned out to be a useful way to build a `PWA` application, albeit a way for me
to learn about the about the `Service Worker` API, the `manifest` concepts, and
why I really don't want to touch another want to touch an Apple device. (Sorry,
but I couldn't get this app to work on on iOS :cry:).
